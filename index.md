This page summarizes two core aspects of the project: 
- The machine learning SVM model that predicts trial-by-trial subject choice based on neural data;
- The neural network model that simulates temporal integration in vision and predicts average subject behavior and neural activity.

# Introduction

In the present research, subjects performed a simple word identification task, illustrated in the below figure:

# Machine learning SVM model

The goal of the SVM (support vector machine) model was to predict subject choice.
